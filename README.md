# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
In this project, we will  identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn.
The Project will include a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package will also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI). 

## Running Files
To run the code you will need to follow the teps below:

1.Clone the repository

2.Create a conda environment

3.Activate the conda environment

4.Install the linter and auto-formatter:
    a.pip install pylint
    b.pip install autopep8

5.Run: 
    a.python churn_library.py
    b.python_script_logging_and_tests.py

6.check the pylint score using the below:
    a.pylint churn_library.py
    b.pylint churn_script_logging_and_tests.py

7.To assist with meeting pep 8 guidelines, use autopep8 via the command line commands below:

    a.autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
    
    b.autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive churn_library.py
